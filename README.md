# PedalPower
Repository for 4th year pedal power project. The project concerns an interactive display using two exercise bikes on campus connected via bluetooth to the display.

The system presents a competed lightbulb game with solo, cooperative and competitive game modes. Logic for the other games and game modes being launched is present but they are not implemented.

All images are placeholder ones and need to be replaced prior to deployment!

The manual for this system can be seen in manual.md for set up process
